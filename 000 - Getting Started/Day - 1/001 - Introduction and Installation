Golang
created by the engineer at Google
Go was created to combine-
  -the ease of programming of an interpreted,dynamically typed language (Such as Python)
  -with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. (such as C++)
  -It also aimed to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing.
