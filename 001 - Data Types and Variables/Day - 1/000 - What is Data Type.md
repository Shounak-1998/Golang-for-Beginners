**What is Data Type?**
  
  A data type is a classification made on the kind of data.
  They categorize a set of related values.
  describe the operation done on them.
  For ex. String-->Which is sequence of character and used to represent text
  Number-->Consist of integers(without decimal like -12 0) and floats(contains decimals such as 7.0 or 85.56.)
  Boolean-->Value True or False
  Array-->An array os like a list or a sequence of elements of a single data type(array of just integer strings or floats)
  Slices-->represent flexible array-like data typebut they alos provide more control over memory allocation.
  Map-->Collection of key value pair for ex. A map of string to integer "x"->30, 1->100, "key"->"value"

**Why are data types needed?**

1. categorize a set of related values
2. describe the operations that can be done on them
